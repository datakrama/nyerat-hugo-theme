## Why the name?

"Nyerat" comes from the Sundanese language which means "Write". This fits with
the basic purpose of a blog, which is to share your writing with the world.  
I hope this theme can make your blog readers more comfortable when reading your
cool articles.

## Why create this?

At first, I wanted to create a personal blog, just to share my thoughts, like in
the past. I want my blog to be fast and accessible. Of course the answer is a
static website. And I know jamstack can make it happen.

I chose Hugo because it could meet my needs, and then decided to create this
theme. Then a question popped into my head, why not just share this theme for
the benefit of others too?
