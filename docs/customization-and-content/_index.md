Adding or customizing content on Hugo is easy. Hugo already has a
[CLI](https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_new/) to do that. In fact this is made
even easier by Nyerat. Nyerat has built-in support for
[Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/). You just need to visit the "cms"
path of your site. For example your domain is <http://example.com>, then Netlify
CMS can be accessed at <http://example.com/cms>.

If you still want the Hugo CLI, and only want to use it to add content, you may
want to
[disable the Netlify CMS]({{< relref "/work/hugo-themes/nyerat/docs/basic-concepts/netlify-integration.md#disable-netlify-cms" >}})
from your site.
