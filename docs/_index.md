## Why the name?

"Nyerat" comes from the Sundanese language which means to write. Yes, it fits
the main purpose of this theme, for blogs. I hope this theme can make your blog
readers more comfortable when reading your cool posts.

## Why create this?

At first, I wanted to create a personal blog, just to share my thoughts, like in
the past. I want my blog to be fast and accessible. Of course the answer is a
static website. And I know jamstack can make it happen.

Therefore, I chose Hugo, and created this theme. Then another question arises,
why not share this theme too?

## Notice

All tutorials in this documentation will use `pnpm` as node package manager. I
highly recommend it for efficiency.  
However, you can still use `npm`, `yarn`, or any other package manager you
usually use.

All tutorials in this documentation also will use `yaml` as format for config
file.  
This is just a personal preference. You can still use other formats like `toml`
or `json`.
