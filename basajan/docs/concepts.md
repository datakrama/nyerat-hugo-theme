## Horizontal scrolling

## Dark theme

The Basajan theme supports dark theme. However, there is no specific method to
switch it manually.

## Optimization

### Font

The Basajan theme uses only system fonts. This way, the browser only uses fonts
that are already on your system and there is no need to download fonts from
external sources.

### Icon

All icons used in the Basajan theme are
[SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG). SVG is the best choice
for today's icons. SVG icons can be compressed to a minimum and still have
excellent quality. This icons are embedded into HTML.
