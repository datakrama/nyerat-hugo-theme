Basajan is a very simple and clean blog theme for Hugo, with 0kb JavaScript
shipped by default. This makes Basajan fast, and also SEO friendly.

## Notice

This documentation contains only a guide on using the Basajan theme. If you are
confused by some terms, or need an explanation of Hugo in general, you can
always read the [official documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/).

This documentation also only uses `yaml` as the
[configuration file](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/#configuration-file)
format. You are expected to adapt if you use other formats like `toml` or
`json`.
